# GitHub account phishing

## 3.4.2020

## Summary
A non-obvious phishing campaign targeted several private mail accounts of status devs with the potential for account takeover or establishing an on device foothold. With (spear-) phishing being an ongoing and hard to mitigate threat, a non-judgemental incident culture for phishing is a good practice and seemed to work well. The company wide 2fa policy should mitigate the larger part of a successful attacks.

## The Impact
No known impact.

### Scope
Private and company mail accounts.

## Trigger

## Action Items
| Action Item | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Further move away from email for authorization and communication to OAuth 2.0/discord. Get feedback from stakeholders, Kick off culture transition | Security culture, structural change |  
| Company wide "incident" channel in discord to make publishing this kind of attack easier and speed up warnings. Clearly define channel purpose, Create channel | Infra | 



## Lessons Learned
### What went well
The phishing mail was in circulation promptly to inform other status employees.

### What went wrong
It's not clear if all employees of status received the headsup. Ideally we would be able to track the origin and impact of this kind of attack more closely.

### Where we got lucky
Smarts and instincts by the affected folks!
