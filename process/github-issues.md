# Security Process Using Github Issues (v1)
This document outlines the process of using Github issues to coordinate security issues of a given project.

## Should you use Github issues?
 Before submitting any issues, be advised: Internal findings are published as Post-Mortems after
 they were reported and mitigated. The Discloser should have already engaged in a conversation
 with the Status Security team about appropriate methods of disclosure for a given project.
 This should be described in the SECURITY.md file within any given repository.
 If it is not, then follow the advice of this repository's [README.md](../README.md).
 If the discloser is still unsure, then please request guidance at security@status.im.

## Process
Once the discloser is aware that Github issues are the appropriate methodology of disclosure, the following procedure is **RECOMMENDED****:
- A github issue **MUST** be created for ever individual assessment discovery
- a `difficulty` label **MUST** be added to every issue. Note this it to track _difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability_.
    - The following options are available:
        - `difficulty:low`
        - `difficulty:medium`
        - `difficulty:high`
        - `difficulty:undetermined`
- a `severity` label **MUST** be added to every issue
    - The following options are available:
        - `severity:informational`
        - `severity:does-not-spark-joy`
        - `severity:low`
        - `severity:medium`
        - `severity:high`
        - `severity:critical`
        - `severity:undetermined`
      - Use [this](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0) resource to help guide which label is appropriate.
- a `status` label **MUST** be added to every issue
    - The following options are available:
        - `status:information-needed`
        - `status:reported`
        - `status:in-progress`
        - `status:awaiting-review`
        - `status:wont-fix`
        - `status:resolved`
- a `type` label **MUST** be added to every issue
    - The following options are available:
        - `type:docs`
        - `type:bug`
        - `type:arch`
        - `type:enhancement`
- a Status owner **SHOULD** be named as decided by the security coordinator to every issue
- a Vendor owner **SHOULD** be named as decided by the vendor to every issue
- The details of any given issues are as follows:
  - a description of the issue **MUST** be included that outlines the specifics of the disclosure
  - an exploit scenario **SHOULD** be included that outlines an example of the potential impact
  - a recommendation **SHOULD** be included that describes how to mitigate the issue
  - references **MAY** be included that expand on the details and surrounding information of the issue

**The disclosure process **MUST** be agreed upon before engagement is to begin.

## Meta
The keywords “**MUST**”, “**MUST NOT**”, “**REQUIRED**”, “**SHALL**”, “**SHALL NOT**”, “**SHOULD**”, “**SHOULD NOT**”, “**RECOMMENDED**”, “**MAY**”, and “**OPTIONAL**” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
